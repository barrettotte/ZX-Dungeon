# ZX-Dungeon
Before the ZX Spectrum Game Jam I had never used BASIC before. 
After walking myself through the BASin manual and tinkering with a few games, 
I had a firm understanding of the language. 
This is a fairly simple game where you collect gold and avoid the enemy. 
It plays a lot like PacMan and is based off of an example located in the ZX Spectrum Coding Club book. 
I had a lot of fun learning this language.
